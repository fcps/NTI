		<h1>FCPS Grants Development &amp; Submission Procedures</h1>
			<p><em>"Grants are not for wishes; they are thoughtfully presented proposals that solve problems."</em> - Johna Rodgers</p>
			<p>The District has established procedures for developing and submitting grant proposals. All grants, regardless of funding amount, <strong>must be approved prior to submission</strong>.  This process begins with the pre-award grants team in the Department of Grants, Research, Accountability, & Data (GRAD).</p>

			<h2>Overview of grants process</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Find a Funding Opportunity/Grant</li>

				<h3 name="find-funding">Finding a Grant:</h3>
				<p>Multiple funding opportunities exist.  The key is finding an opportunity that is a) a good fit for your idea and b) one in which the school/district is eligible to apply.  The pre-award grants team developed the Funding Opportunities’ Database, available at <a href="https://bit.ly/2MB36aN" target="_blank">https://bit.ly/2MB36aN</a>. <em>You may have to log-in using your email and password</em>. </p>

				<h3 name="intent-to-apply">Intent to Apply:</h3>
				<p>When you have found a suitable grant opportunity, please open the Pre-Award Grants Portal at <a href="https://bit.ly/2NTj04d" target="_blank">https://bit.ly/2NTj04d</a> and complete the Intent to Apply form. You will need to respond to each item in the form before you submit the request. <em>Pro Tip: Discuss your project with your principal/supervisor <strong>BEFORE</strong> you submit the Intent to Apply form and remind them to check their email <strong>AFTER</strong> you submit</em>.</p>

				<h3 name="supervisor-approval">Supervisor Approval:</h3>
				<p>When you submit your Intent to Apply request, your principal/ supervisor is notified.  S/he must give approval. Please follow-up with your principal/supervisor to ensure s/he sees the approval email.</p>

				<h3 name="eligibility">Eligibility Review:</h3>
				<p>After your principal/supervisor approves the project, the pre-award grants team will review for eligibility and let you know whether or not to proceed with proposal development. </p>

				<h3 name="development">Proposal Development:</h3>
				<p>The pre-award grants team can’t write every grant in the district, but we provide technical assistance to those who are.</p>

				<h3 name="submission">Proposal Approval &amp; Submission:</h3>
				<p>The pre-award grants team facilitates getting your proposal approved for submission.  If you have questions, please contact either <a href="mailto:Angela.Roberts@fayette.kyschools.us?subject=Questions About Submitting a Grant">Angela Roberts</a> or <a href="mailto:Susan.Davis@fayette.kyschools.us?subject=Questions About Submitting a Grant">Susan Decker Davis</a>. </p>

				<h3 name="award">Notification of Award Status:</h3>
				<p>Please notify the pre-award grants team when you find out whether or not your proposal has been selected for an award.</p>
