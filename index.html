							<li>Providing equitable access to opportunities to <strong>ALL</strong> students</li>

							<!-- To add bullet points for speaker notes I recommend using bullet 
								 points.  If you need to remember that the things need to be 
								 stated in order, you'll want to change the first thing below from
								 <ul> (Unordered List) to <ol> (Ordered List) and make the same 
								 change at the end of the bullet points. -->

								<!-- First Bullet Point. -->
								<li>Grants are about accomplishing goals.</li>

								<li>If your need and goal are not compelling, why would an organization give you money for your project?</li>

								<!-- Fourth Bullet Point. -->
								<li>Accomplishing goals requires planning, coordination, and a design for success.</li>

								<!-- Fifth Bullet Point. -->
								<li>We can be your thought partner for your project and help you write it, but ultimately you need to design your project.</li>
